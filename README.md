## Path planning reinforcement learning in a dynamic environment



## Project Overview

This README provides an overview of the project that combines Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Q-Learning algorithms for solving the path planning problem in a dynamic environment with multiple robots. The project aims to develop an efficient and adaptive solution to navigate multiple robots while avoiding conflicts and adapting to changing conditions.

## Features

- **Conflict-Based Search (CBS):** Implement the CBS algorithm to handle collision avoidance and path optimization among multiple robots. CBS efficiently resolves conflicts and generates collision-free paths.

- **Q-Learning for Adaptation:** Integrate Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to enable robots to learn and adapt their paths based on the changing environment and dynamic obstacles.

- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Develop a decision-making mechanism that combines CBS and Q-Learning to allow robots to dynamically adjust their routes while considering potential conflicts and learned Q-values.
